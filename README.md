- Triggers deployment automatically

## 🔄 How CI/CD Works
### Push code → GitHub → GitHub Actions builds → Deploys to AWS Amplify → Live Website Updated

No manual uploads needed.
Every change you push becomes live automatically. 🚀

---

## 📦 How to Run Locally
```
git clone https://github.com/aakansha113/<repo-name>.git
